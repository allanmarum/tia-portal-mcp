Large catalog searches can be narrowed with query/maxResults or split into separate network_read calls. read_hardware_config accepts optional deviceName (exact device filter), plcName (PLC for tag matching), includeIoDetails (structured addresses and channels), and includeTagMatches (requires includeIoDetails) — detailed output can be large, so filter by deviceName or split into separate calls.")]
