# Improvement Log — tia-portal-mcp

Engineering log for this project, started 2026-07-15. **Open follow-ups come first; completed work
is grouped at the end.** Entries are kept verbatim as a record of what was found and when.

Originally consolidated from three parallel reviews (C# correctness, silent-failure hunt, AI-agent usability audit)
plus manual verification of the highest-stakes claims. Test suite at authoring time: 146/146 green
(pure-logic tests only; no integration coverage of the worker or IPC layer). As of 2026-07-20 the
suite is 341/341 green and does cover the worker/IPC layer via the fake-worker harness.

## Overall verdict

Solid foundation: the batch-tool consolidation (45 → 16 tools), typed batch item schema with
per-property descriptions, the preview→token→apply safety model, and the audit trail are all
well-designed. The three biggest problems, in order of impact:

1. **Process-per-request worker transport** — every tool call spawns a fresh net48 worker,
   re-attaches to TIA Portal, and never closes projects it opens. This is the root cause of
   latency, token-expiry brittleness, and leaked project handles.
2. **Error signals get lost on the way to the agent** — worker stderr is discarded on success,
   ~20 catch blocks degrade results silently, two write operations report success after failing,
   and the whole host layer re-derives failure from an `"Error:"` string prefix.
3. **Small-model traps** — silently-ignored misspelled optional params, unbounded response
   payloads (up to 50 concatenated in one batch), token rejections without recovery hints,
   and schema descriptions that contradict the code.

---

## Phase 0 — Quick wins (small-model usability; ~1 day total, all low-risk)

| # | Change | Where | Why |
|---|--------|-------|-----|
| 0.1 | Unknown-operation error lists all valid names for the batch category | `Batch/BatchOperationCatalog.cs:144` | Most common dead-end for weak models; `CrossReferenceFilterNames.cs:43` already sets the precedent — DONE 2026-07-15 |
| 0.2 | Aggregate ALL batch validation errors instead of failing on the first | `BatchOperationCatalog.cs:77-112` | One round-trip fixes N mistakes instead of N round-trips — DONE 2026-07-15 |
| 0.3 | Append recovery instruction ("tokens are single-use, expire after 10 min; call preview_* again") to all 7 token-rejection texts; state the 10-min TTL in preview tool descriptions + README | `Safety/WriteSafetyService.cs:87-124`, `Batch/BatchTools.cs`, `Tools/ProjectLifecycleTools.cs`, README | Agent can self-recover without inference — DONE 2026-07-15 |
| 0.4 | Fix schema-facing description drift: `newName` falsely claims user-constant rename (`BatchOperationRequest.cs:47`, `BatchWorkerInvoker.cs:46` never forwards it — implement or remove the claim); `blockPath` omits `compile_check` scoping; `filter` lists 2 of 4 values and doesn't name its operation; `plcName` doesn't say which ops honor it | `Batch/BatchOperationRequest.cs` | The flat DTO makes descriptions the load-bearing contract — DONE 2026-07-15 |
| 0.5 | README drift: add `get_project_status` to batch read list (line 18); document `forceRebind` escape hatch; unify the two "already bound" error texts (`ProjectSessionBinding.cs:42` should mention forceRebind like `OpennessWorkerClient.cs:580` does) | README, Contracts | Three sources of truth currently disagree — DONE 2026-07-15 |
| 0.6 | Log audit-write failures to stderr/ILogger instead of bare `catch { }` | `Safety/WriteSafetyService.cs:164` | Silent loss of audit trail on a PLC-mutating tool — DONE 2026-07-15 |

## Phase 1 — Error propagation correctness (~2-4 days)

| # | Change | Where | Why |
|---|--------|-------|-----|
| 1.1 | Replace the `"Error:"` string-prefix convention with a structured result record (`Success`, `Payload`, `Error`) threaded through client → batch → safety → tools | `OpennessWorkerClient.cs:552`, `BatchExecutionEngine.cs:10`, `WriteSafetyTooling.cs:30,58,83`, `ProjectLifecycleTools.cs` (5 sites), `BatchTools.cs:139` | Any payload legitimately starting with "Error:" is misclassified; false-success bugs become structurally impossible — DONE 2026-07-16 |
| 1.2 | **False-success writes**: `NetworkDeviceCreator.cs:23-31` must fail the response when `CreateWithItem` throws (today: buried warning + `Success=true`, and batch stop-on-failure doesn't stop). `NetworkDeviceConfigurator.cs:71-74` must fail when ALL requested settings were skipped | worker Openness/ | CRITICAL: agent believes a device exists that doesn't; audit log records success — DONE 2026-07-15 |
| 1.3 | Surface worker stderr: attach non-empty stderr as `warnings` on `WorkerResponse` and/or log via host ILogger; route per-item "Skipping X" degradation messages into `messages` arrays on the payload DTOs (pattern already used correctly by `CrossReferenceReader` and `CompileChecker`) | `OpennessWorkerClient.cs:633-656`, ~20 catch sites in worker readers | `browse_project_tree`/`read_hardware_config` can silently return partial trees today — DONE 2026-07-16 |
| 1.4 | `HardwareConfigReader` fallback defaults (`0`/`""`/`null`) indistinguishable from real values → nullable + `messages` marker | `HardwareConfigReader.cs:260-297` | Agent can't tell "read failed" from "actual value" — DONE 2026-07-16 |
| 1.5 | Add `Win32Exception` to the client catch filters with an actionable message (missing .NET FX 4.8 / corrupt openness-worker folder); include exception type name in the worker's catch-all error; wrap `SaveProjectAsAsync` like its siblings | `OpennessWorkerClient.cs:392,431,556,630`, worker `Program.cs:86-90` | The one prerequisite failure that surfaces as a raw protocol error today — DONE 2026-07-16 |
| 1.6 | Reject unknown JSON properties on batch items (`JsonUnmappedMemberHandling.Disallow` or equivalent SDK option) | host serializer config | Misspelled OPTIONAL params (`ip_adress`) currently succeed silently — the most dangerous trap found — DONE 2026-07-16 |
| 1.7 | Narrow bare `catch (Exception)` in `EquipmentCatalogSearcher.cs` reflection helpers to `EngineeringException`/`TargetInvocationException`, merging with the existing `OpennessReflection` helpers | worker Openness/ | Bugs currently masquerade as empty search results — DONE 2026-07-16 |

## Phase 2 — Structural (the big wins; ~1-2 weeks)

| # | Change | Where | Why |
|---|--------|-------|-----|
| 2.1 | **Persistent worker process**: keep the worker alive across requests (request loop already exists in worker `Program.cs:34` — the client kills it by closing stdin at `OpennessWorkerClient.cs:635`). Single `Attach()`, managed project open/close, health check + restart-on-crash, `SemaphoreSlim` serialization of requests | `OpennessWorkerClient.cs` | Fixes all 3 CRITICALs at once (re-attach per call, leaked project handles, concurrent mutation races); cuts preview→apply wall-clock far below the 10-min token TTL; makes 50-item batches practical (today: up to 3N spawns per write batch) — DONE 2026-07-16 |
| 2.2 | Interim (if 2.1 is deferred): add `SemaphoreSlim(1,1)` around `SendAsync` now | `OpennessWorkerClient.cs:614` | One-line mitigation for the concurrency CRITICAL — DONE 2026-07-15 |
| 2.3 | **Bound read payloads**: `depth`/`startPath` on `browse_project_tree`, `maxResults` on `search_equipment_catalog` + `read_cross_references`, plus a server-side byte budget with an explicit "truncated — narrow with plcName/filter/startPath" trailer | worker readers + batch schema | Only finding that can hard-kill a small model's session (README's own smoke test batches tree+hw+xref+catalog into one call) — DONE 2026-07-16 |
| 2.4 | Collapse lifecycle preview/apply pairs: calling a write tool WITHOUT a token returns the preview + token instead of an error → 16 tools become 10 | `Tools/ProjectLifecycleTools.cs` | Removes the "which preview matches this apply" lookup; kills the asymmetric-naming trap (`preview_write_batch`/`apply_write_batch` vs `preview_open_project`/`open_project`) — DONE 2026-07-16 |
| 2.5 | Evict expired tokens (sweep on `CreatePreview` is enough — no timer needed); validate token BEFORE the expensive N-spawn state re-read in apply | `WriteSafetyService.cs:16-36`, `BatchTools.cs:94-110` | Unbounded memory growth; dead tokens currently cost a full read pass — DONE 2026-07-16 |

## Phase 3 — Simplification (behavior-preserving refactors)

| # | Change | Where | Est. reduction |
|---|--------|-------|----------------|
| 3.1 | ~~Extract per-op descriptor + one generic executor for the six lifecycle preview/apply pairs.~~ **DROPPED 2026-07-20** — Phase 2.4 already collapsed `ProjectLifecycleTools.cs` from 374 to 125 lines. The six tools are ~12 lines each and the shared machinery lives in `WriteSafetyTooling`; what remains is genuinely per-operation. A descriptor table would add indirection without removing duplication. | `ProjectLifecycleTools.cs` (125 lines) | Resolved by 2.4 |
| 3.2 | Consolidate the 3 near-identical project-path binding checks into `ProjectSessionBinding` | `OpennessWorkerClient.cs`, `ProjectSessionBinding.cs` | drift risk — DONE 2026-07-20 |
| 3.3 | Collapse the double dispatch: `BatchWorkerInvoker` maps operation strings onto 20+ near-identical `OpennessWorkerClient` wrappers that only set `WorkerRequest` fields — build `WorkerRequest` directly from the batch item | `OpennessWorkerClient.cs:25-359`, `BatchWorkerInvoker.cs` | ~250 lines — **DEFERRED 2026-07-20**; design retained in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-20-phase3-simplification-design.md` |
| 3.4 | ~~Merge `EquipmentCatalogSearcher`'s private reflection helpers (~90 lines) into `OpennessReflection`~~ **DROPPED 2026-07-20** — Phase 1.7 already did the merge. The remaining privates are `HasReadableProperty` (3 lines), `ReadStringProperty` (a 2-line passthrough already delegating to `OpennessReflection`), and two non-reflection helpers. ~10 lines of residual value. | worker Openness/ | Resolved by 1.7 |
| 3.5 | Share the host presentation `JsonSerializerOptions` (was duplicated byte-identically in 3 files) via `TiaMcpServer/Json/TiaJson.cs`. **Corrected scope:** the original entry claimed one config duplicated in 4 files. There are two distinct configs — presentation (3 host copies, deduped) and wire/IPC (`PersistentWorkerTransport` + worker `Program.cs`, which differ deliberately and live in separate processes; sharing them would require a `System.Text.Json` PackageReference on the dependency-free `Contracts` assembly). Wire options intentionally left per-process. | host | consistency — DONE 2026-07-20 (presentation only) |
| 3.5b | Inject `WriteSafetyService` via DI instead of the static audit path (registration already exists in `Program.cs`) | host | **DONE 2026-07-20 (Round 4, Task 2).** The tool layer receives the service through DI, so tests inject a temporary audit directory. |
| 3.6 | `WorkerRequest` god DTO (47 fields): defer full split — flat is a defensible MCP trade-off — but group with `#region` per operation family and add a comment mapping fields→operations | Contracts | documentation — DONE 2026-07-20 |

## Found during live testing against TIA Portal V21 (2026-07-20)

**Pre-Task-2 audit contamination is resolved — DONE via 3.5b (Round 4, Task 2).**
39 of 42 records in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TiaMcpServer\audit` were produced by `dotnet test`, not by
real TIA usage. Before Task 2, the tool layer used the production audit directory, and every test run
appended real records — recognizable by `projectPath` values pointing into `TiaMcpServer.Tests\bin\`
and FakeWorker scripted keywords (`ok`, `hang`, `worker-error`) in `target`. The audited tool layer
now receives `WriteSafetyService` through DI, and tests inject a temporary audit directory.

This diluted the forensic record for PLC-mutating operations to ~7% signal, and a test run could be
mistaken for real engineering activity. It was the concrete justification for **3.5b** above: the
`WriteSafetyService(getUtcNow, tokenLifetime, auditDirectory)` constructor already supported
redirecting the audit directory, but the tool layer could not use that test-specific directory before
Task 2. DI now makes that isolation available to the tests.


Also confirmed live, all working as designed: bounded reads with `depth`/`startPath`/`maxResults`
plus the explicit truncation trailer (2.3); per-item batch isolation, where a failing `compile_check`
did not stop two sibling reads; `messages` arrays surfacing partial-read degradation rather than
silently returning defaults (1.3/1.4) — `read_hardware_config` reported 20 unreadable device
addresses, and `read_cross_references` reported "does not expose the cross-reference service"
instead of an empty result an agent would misread as "no unused objects"; single-use safety tokens
rejecting replay with the self-recovery instruction (0.3); and audit records whose
`requestedInputHash` matches the issuing preview exactly.

Separately, `compile_check` failed live with "Object 'PlcSoftware' does not expose a Compile
method" against the installed `tia-mcp 2.3.0` — already fixed on `main` by ae8af80, confirming that
fix addresses a real-hardware failure and that 2.3.0 predates it.

## Follow-ups discovered during Phase 3 (2026-07-20)

Documenting the `WorkerRequest` field→operation contract (3.6) surfaced two more instances of the
same "declared but never forwarded" bug class Phase 0.4 found with `newName`. Round 4 resolved the
software-side behavior and added forwarding coverage for every declared field; the hardware question
for tag creation remains deferred.

- **`deviceItemName` on `configure_network_device`**: `BatchOperationRequest.cs` describes it
  unscoped ("Optional device item name; defaults to deviceName when omitted"), but
  `ConfigureNetworkDeviceAsync` has no such parameter and `BatchWorkerInvoker` never passes one.
  Only `add_network_device` forwards it. An agent setting it on `configure_network_device` has it
  silently dropped. **Resolved (Round 4, Task 7):** catalog validation now rejects
  `deviceItemName` for `configure_network_device` rather than accepting and dropping it.
- **`externalAccessible` / `externalVisible` / `externalWritable` / `isSafety` on `create_tag`**:
  described as generic "Optional tag attribute", but only `update_tag` forwards them. `create_tag`
  drops all four. **Resolved interim behavior (Round 4):** `create_tag` now errors when any of
  these attributes is supplied instead of silently dropping it. Whether Openness supports forwarding
  them at tag-creation time remains a hardware-gated decision.

A forwarding test now covers every declared field, preventing another declared-but-unforwarded field
from silently reaching the worker boundary.

Three further follow-ups, all raised by the Phase 3 final review and deliberately left undone:

- **Enforce the `WorkerRequest` forwarding comments with a test.** **DONE (Round 4):** the field→
  operation forwarding map is now tested for every declared field.
- **Collapse `BatchPayloadBudget.ReadBatchResponseLength` into `BatchResultFormatter.ReadBatch`.**
  It currently hand-mirrors that method's envelope purely to predict its output length. Phase 3
  made the two share `TiaJson.Presentation` so they cannot drift on serializer settings, but the
  duplicated envelope shape remains. Replacing the body with
  `BatchResultFormatter.ReadBatch(results).Length` removes it, at the cost of one extra
  serialization per budget probe — measure before adopting.
- **`TiaJson.Presentation.MakeReadOnly()`.** **DONE (Round 4):** presentation serialization options
  are frozen, protecting the safety-token `requestedInputHash` format.

## Deferred / explicitly not planned

- Openness `Transaction` and `ExclusiveAccess` APIs, authentication/authorization-event subscriptions,
  server-push/long-polling MCP notifications, and exposing `doctor` diagnostics as an MCP-callable tool
  (it remains CLI-only via `tia-mcp doctor`) — all out of Phase 5 production scope (AC-044); Phase 6+
  candidates.
- Splitting `WorkerRequest` into per-operation DTOs (churn > value while the protocol is stable).
- MCP protocol-level error signaling instead of text results (needs SDK investigation; revisit after 1.1).
- `NetworkDeviceConfigurator` speculative-reflection "UNVERIFIED SDK CALL" paths: verify against real
  Openness V21 API on the TIA machine and pin exact method signatures (needs hardware access).
- **Next round (needs TIA Portal hardware):** forward `externalAccessible`/`externalVisible`/
  `externalWritable`/`isSafety` on `create_tag` if Openness V21 permits setting them at tag-creation
  time — Round 4 narrowed this to that single question by making the fields an explicit error
  instead of a silent drop. Same session should verify the `NetworkDeviceConfigurator`
  "UNVERIFIED SDK CALL" reflection paths and decide whether `deviceItemName` is meaningful for
  `configure_network_device`.

## Testing gaps to close alongside

- The fake-worker executable test harness now covers the timeout path and persistent-worker restart logic
  through `OpennessWorkerClientIntegrationTests` — DONE 2026-07-16. Stderr propagation, malformed JSON,
  and Win32Exception launch failure are also covered.
- Batch validation aggregation (0.2) and unknown-property rejection (1.6) are pure-logic → plain xunit.
- The 146 existing tests are contract/formatting tests; none exercise a worker process.

## Suggested sequencing

Phase 0 → 1.2 + 1.6 (the two false-success traps) → 2.2 (one-line concurrency guard) → rest of
Phase 1 → 2.1 persistent worker → 2.3 payload bounds → 2.4 tool collapse → Phase 3 opportunistically
alongside whichever files each phase already touches.
## Session binding now protects the default case — DONE 2026-07-20 (Round 4)

The chosen fix binds a session from the worker-reported active-project path after its first
successful call; the worker report is the ground truth. For project-scoped operations, once bound, a
call that names a different `projectPath` is rejected unless `open_project` uses `forceRebind=true`.

Read-side project-open policy completes the other half of the fix for project-scoped read paths: they
will not switch the project currently open in TIA Portal. They return: "TIA Portal currently has
project 'A' open, but this request targets 'B'. Read operations never switch projects. Omit
projectPath to use the open project, or call open_project to switch." `get_project_status(projectPath)`
is a known exception deferred to Round 5 because its lifecycle RPC also serves guarded write-state
probes; do not use it to switch projects. Use `open_project` for a deliberate session switch.

## Read-side project-open policy — DONE 2026-07-20 (Round 4)

Project-scoped read paths use the read-side open policy. A request targeting a project other than the
one open in TIA Portal is refused; callers omit `projectPath` to use the active project or use
`open_project` to switch. `get_project_status(projectPath)` is the known deferred exception: it still
uses the lifecycle RPC shared with guarded write-state probes and can request the supplied path. Do
not rely on it for session switching; use `open_project` instead. Splitting the user-facing status
read from the write-side probe remains a Round 5 task.






### Smaller follow-ups from the same review

- **No test for the declined-bind warning branch** in `OpennessWorkerClient`. Reaching it needs a
  controlled interleaving, not a race: add a `delay` FakeWorker scenario, start the call, and bind
  from the test thread while the await is provably pending. `ProjectSessionBinding` is `sealed` with
  non-virtual methods, so the test-double route is closed without touching production code.
- **`ProjectPathNormalization`'s exception fallback is untested**, and being `internal` it is now
  harder to reach directly. Note that `Path.GetFullPath`'s throwing behaviour differs between net48
  (where the worker runs) and net8.0 (where the tests run), so a net8.0 test cannot characterise what
  the worker actually does with an odd path.
- **FakeWorker scenario keys are literal Windows paths** (`TiaMcpServer.FakeWorker/Program.cs:286,293`)
  because `projectPath` doubles as the dispatch key. A separate `scenarioKey` field would age better.
- **`Stamp`'s comment claims its stderr write lands in this response's warnings**, which depends on
  drain timing — the same assumption the containment above would rest on. Verify or soften.
- **Duplicate tests in `ProjectSessionBindingTests.cs`** (`FirstExplicitProjectPathResolvesWithoutBindingTheSession`
  vs `TryResolve_DoesNotAdoptTheRequestedPath`; `DifferentProjectPathIsRejectedAfterBinding` vs
  `TryResolve_StillRejectsADifferentPathOnceBound`) — inherited from the plan's mandated test set.
- **`TiaJson.cs`** — the static-constructor comment duplicates the field's XML-doc rationale.
- **`GetStatus`'s graceful `IsOpen=false` branch** looks unreachable: `EnsureProject` throws first.
  Predates Round 4; will be revisited by the read-tool/write-probe split above.

### Process note

The `get_project_status` route was missed because Task 5's scope was defined by *mechanism*
("operations going through `WithProject`") rather than by *capability* ("everything that can cause a
project to open"). Two of Round 4's most serious findings — this one and the divergence
mis-specification above — were only visible from a whole-branch view; neither could have been caught
by reviewing a single task's diff. Worth budgeting for a broad review pass on any change that spans
a process boundary.

## CI and coverage foundation — DONE 2026-07-23 (Phase 5 Plan 1)

Solution builds are serialized (`-m:1`), a scoped coverage gate is wired into CI (collect → enforce
locally at `>= 0.80` → Codecov upload, reporting-only), and all three are pinned by named tests in
`CiWorkflowTests`/`CoverageThresholdScriptTests`.

A gap was found and fixed mid-implementation: `TiaMcpServer.Tests` has no `ProjectReference` to
`TiaMcpServer` (deliberate — a normal reference would drag `TiaMcpServer.csproj`'s `BeforeTargets="Build"`
hook into building the net48 Openness worker against real `Siemens.Engineering*.dll`). Host code
instead reaches the test project via `<Compile Include>` and compiles into the `TiaMcpServer.Tests`
module, so assembly-scoped Coverlet filters (`[TiaMcpServer]*`) could never see it — the real Cobertura
report contained only `TiaMcpServer.Contracts` (92%), while all host logic was silently swallowed by the
`[TiaMcpServer.Tests]*` exclude. Fixed with namespace-scoped filters instead (`[TiaMcpServer.Tests]TiaMcpServer.*`
include, carving back out `TiaMcpServer.Tests.*` and `TiaMcpServer.OpennessWorker.*`) plus
`IncludeTestAssembly=true` (Coverlet defaults this `false`, which alone would have made the filter
change a no-op). New aggregate: 0.836.

### Follow-up architectural task (flagged by the final whole-branch review, not fixed in Plan 1)

The fix above is correct today but couples the coverage gate's meaning to a namespace-naming
convention rather than assembly identity: a future host class placed outside the `TiaMcpServer.*`
namespace would be silently excluded from coverage (undercounting real code, potentially masking a
genuine regression without failing any test), and a test-support class placed outside
`TiaMcpServer.Tests.*` would be silently counted as production. The durable fix is a real
`ProjectReference` from `TiaMcpServer.Tests` to `TiaMcpServer` with a build path that stays stub-safe
(doesn't force the net48 Openness worker's real Siemens-DLL build during `dotnet test`). Scope that as
its own task rather than folding it into a later phase's unrelated work. A cheap interim guard in the
meantime: a test that fails if any instrumented type in the test assembly matching include-minus-exclude
is itself a `[Fact]`/`[Theory]`-bearing class, turning silent scope drift into a loud one.

### Smaller follow-ups from the same review

- **`ReadRunCommandBlocks` (`CiWorkflowTests.cs`) misses inline `- run: <command>` YAML shorthand** —
  the key-position guard rejects any line where text before `run:` is non-blank, which includes the
  `- ` array-item marker. A solution build written in that shorthand (no sibling `name:`) would escape
  the `-m:1` enforcement entirely. Not used by any current workflow; widen the guard to also accept a
  lone leading `- ` if that style is ever introduced.
- **`GetRepositoryRoot()` is duplicated verbatim** between `CiWorkflowTests.cs` and
  `CoverageThresholdScriptTests.cs`, and its 4-level `../` walk assumes the standard
  `bin/<config>/<tfm>/` output layout. Extract to one shared test helper.
- **The threshold script accepts `NaN`/`Infinity` as a passing line-rate** (`NaN -lt $min` is `false`
  in .NET) — unreachable with real Cobertura output, but an explicit `IsNaN`/`IsInfinity` guard is
  cheap insurance.
- **`CoverageThresholdScriptTests.RunScript` reads stdout then stderr with sequential `ReadToEnd()`
  before `WaitForExit()`** — deadlock-prone in theory if either buffer fills; harmless today given the
  script's one-line output. Switch to async reads if the script's output ever grows.
- Status/error message interpolation in the threshold script isn't invariant-culture (cosmetic; moot
  on GitHub's en-US-locale runners).
- Worst-covered (0% line-rate) host classes, now visible now for the first time thanks to the fix
  above, noted as a possible future test-writing target: `EnvironmentVariableService`,
  `FileSystemService`, `ProcessEnumerationService`, `RegistryService`, `WindowsIdentityService` (thin
  OS-adapter classes).

## Lifecycle and response integrity — DONE 2026-07-23 (Phase 5 Plan 2)

Closed the `WorkerFailureCategories` vocabulary (`validation_error`, `binding_conflict`, `state_changed`,
`worker_operation_failed`, `worker_timeout`, `worker_crashed`, `postcondition_failed`) across every
guarded write path; split the user-facing `get_project_status` read from the internal
`probe_project_status_for_lifecycle` write-state probe so status reads are side-effect-free and never
open or switch projects; introduced an explicit `BindingTransition` model so session binding only
adopts worker-reported ground truth, never caller input; fixed a `save_project_as` divergence where a
successful SaveAs could leave the host and worker bound to different projects; and made
`save_project_as(rebind:false)` a rejected `validation_error` before any preview, token, or Siemens
call. Automated gates pass: full suite green at the Plan 2 tip (branch
`fix/phase5-02-lifecycle-response-integrity`, commit `66cce7b`), 506/506.

**Certification evidence recorded:** Task 2 of the Phase 5 Plan 4 certification plan recorded live
TIA Portal V21 evidence for the externally observable lifecycle cases. The internal-only timeout,
crash, and null-binding cases remain primarily covered by the automated FakeWorker suite; the
acceptance report records each scope boundary explicitly.

## PLC block-write repairs — DONE 2026-07-25 (Phase 5 Plan 3 + block-write-format-repair follow-up)

Plan 3 (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-23-phase5-03-plc-block-write-repairs.md`) added block-bundle
parsing/staging validation (reject missing/duplicate documents, unsafe filenames, path traversal),
postcondition verification for `update_block_logic` and `create_block` (compile/re-export checks
instead of trusting Siemens' import return value), and SCL source generation. Automated gates passed
at the Plan 3 tip (branch `codex/phase5-03-plc-block-write-repairs`, commit `e65dc64`), full suite
582/582.

Live manual testing on 2026-07-25 (see `priv/MCP_TOOL_TEST_REPORT_2026-07-25.md`) found Plan 3's
postcondition checks did not catch a real corruption bug: `BlockExporter.Export()` omitted a newline
before each `--- FILE: ... ---` marker after the first, so `BlockImportBundleParser`'s
multiline-anchored delimiter regex could not see any delimiter past the first, and any multi-document
block round trip silently corrupted. Also found `create_block` failed outright for `language=SCL`
(schema-invalid template) and had no working input for `blockType=GlobalDB`.

The 2026-07-25 block-write-format-repair follow-up plan
(`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-25-block-write-format-repair.md`, Tasks 1-7, commits `d105dfb`..`81b73fc`)
fixed all three: `BlockBundleFormat.Compose` now guarantees a newline before every marker after the
first; block-document import routes Simatic ML XML through `BlockImportRouting` with a
non-authoritative-document guard; `GlobalDB` creation now defaults to/requires `language="DB"`;
SCL/STL compile units use a schema-valid empty `<NetworkSource />` instead of a raw-text
`StructuredText` node. Automated gates pass: full suite 615/615 at commit `81b73fc`.

**Certification evidence recorded:** Task 2 of the Phase 5 Plan 4 certification plan confirmed the
authoritative-document byte-identical and edited `update_block_logic` paths, malformed-bundle
non-mutation, and SCL `create_block` resolution/compilation on TIA Portal V21. The report retains
the exact scope caveats for non-authoritative document companions and unexercised block types; those
are evidence boundaries, not known unresolved product defects. README now documents the verified
recovery behavior rather than carrying a stale pending-live caveat.

## Phase 5 certification documentation — DONE 2026-07-25 (Phase 5 Plan 4 Tasks 1–4)

The repository documentation and the authorized source `tia-portal-mcp` skill now describe the
ten-tool public surface, self-previewing lifecycle writes, non-binding status reads, required
`save_project_as(rebind:true)`, categorized failures, separate warnings, and verified block-write

graph/review and final automated acceptance gates; Phase 6 exclusions below remain unchanged.

## Complete read-only project metadata for get_project_status - DONE 2026-08-08

`get_project_status` now returns the extended read-only project metadata surface on TIA Portal V21.
`ProjectStatusInfo.Metadata` is additive and backward compatible (absent when no project is open),
populated only by the direct read path: the write-side lifecycle probe payloads and their
safety-token binding are byte-for-byte unchanged.

New fields: `copyright`, `family`, multilingual `comment` (all translations, culture name per
translation, source order preserved), `languageSettings` (`languages` / `activeLanguages` as
culture names, nullable `editingLanguage` / `referenceLanguage`), `historyEntries` (text and
date-time, verbatim, no dedup, deterministically capped at 200 with an explicit
`historyTruncated` flag), `usedProducts` (`{name, version}`, no inference or silent dedup), and
`compilationSettings` (`isCompilationEnabled` reads of `PlcSimulationSettingsProvider` and
`VirtualPlcSettingsProvider` via `GetService<T>()`). An unavailable provider/value degrades to null
with a response warning rather than a fabricated default; only `EngineeringException` is caught for
degradation; unrelated errors fail normally. Read-only enforced by source contract: the reader
never saves, sets attributes, deletes, opens, closes, or uses `ExclusiveAccess`, and compile/build
pass both against the CI stubs (`/p:UseTiaPortalReferenceStubs=true`) and the real V21 assemblies.
Full suite green at this tip: 1980/1980.

Review fixes (PR #24, review 4892632840): `historyTruncated` is now tri-state — `false` (read,
below cap), `true` (read, capped), `null` (history unavailable/could not be read); the history
reader `break`s as soon as the first entry beyond the cap is detected instead of enumerating the
rest; the successful `get_project_status` response is capped by the existing standalone 60000
character budget with an explicit truncation marker; and lifecycle post-write verification now uses
a narrowly-scoped internal basic-status read (`get_basic_project_status` /
`GetBasicStatusReadOnly`) so `open_project`, `create_project`, `save_project`, `save_project_as`,
and `archive_project` never perform the extended metadata read after a write. The history cap was
lowered from 1000 to 200 entries so a full history payload stays well inside the response budget.

## Structured read-only PLC I/O map for read_hardware_config - DONE 2026-08-13

`read_hardware_config` now supports opt-in, read-only structured I/O extraction. A default read
(with no flags) is byte-identical to earlier versions: `DeviceItemInfo.IoDetails` is
`JsonIgnore(WhenWritingNull)` so it is absent from default output and from internal network-write
safety-token state hashes, which stay lightweight and unchanged.

New request options: `deviceName` (ordinal-ignore-case, exactly-one-match device filter), `plcName`
(exact ordinal PLC selection for tag matching), `includeIoDetails` (structured `ioDetails` with
addresses and channels), and `includeTagMatches` (requires `includeIoDetails`). New Contracts DTOs
`DeviceItemIoDetailsInfo`/`IoAddressInfo`/`IoChannelInfo`/`IoTagMatchInfo` carry raw Openness
evidence: byte-based address `startAddress`/`length`, bit-based channel
`channelAddressBits`/`channelWidthBits`, dynamic `context`, and ordinal `controllerNames`;
unreadable scalars stay null and are never fabricated. Pure TIA-free `IoLogicalAddressFormatter`
(bit/byte/word/dword parse + format with strict alignment and casing/whitespace normalization,
rejecting `%M`/DB/symbolic-only) and `IoTagMatcher` (exact normalized interval + I/O-area equality,
no overlap or first-match fallback, multiple tags per channel) live in `TiaMcpServer.Contracts`.

The worker reads `DeviceItem.Addresses`/`Channels` and `AddressControllers` through the typed
Openness API (present in the CI stubs), reads the dynamic `ChannelAddress`/`ChannelWidth`/`Context`
attributes through guarded `GetAttribute`, resolves the PLC deterministically (exact `plcName`, or
the single PLC when omitted), builds the tag index once per selected PLC via `TagTableReader`, and
matches tags only when the controller association deterministically names the selected PLC — never
across controllers. The payload contract validates every non-null collection and nested object
inside `ioDetails` and rejects an explicit null collection as `protocol_error` without echoing the
payload. FakeWorker scenarios, the read-only live harness
`scripts/live-test-network-io-map.ps1` (never run by automated tests), and the full I/O-map test
surface were added. Full suite green at this tip: 2136/2136.
