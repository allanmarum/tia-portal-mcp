# Project history — specs, plans, and acceptance reports

**This tree is development-process history, not current documentation.**

It holds the design specs, implementation plans, and live acceptance reports produced while
building features. Read it to understand *why* something was built the way it was, or to audit
what was verified and when.

Do not read it as a description of how the server behaves today:

- A document describes the state of the world **on its date**. Later work may have superseded it.
- Designs here were sometimes revised during implementation. The code, [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md),
  and [SupportedOperations](../SupportedOperations/README.md) are the authorities on current behavior.
- Nothing here is a support document. For using the server, start at the [documentation index](../README.md).

These files are kept for auditability and are intentionally not pruned.

## Specs
